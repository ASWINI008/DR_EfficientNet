# Retinal Disease Classification using EfficientNet

## Project Overview
This project uses **Deep Learning** to detect retinal diseases from fundus images. Early detection of conditions like diabetic retinopathy (DR) can prevent vision loss. The project includes a **Streamlit web application** where users can upload a retinal image and receive a prediction of the disease stage.

## Features
- Detects **5 stages of Diabetic Retinopathy**:
  1. No DR
  2. Mild DR
  3. Moderate DR
  4. Severe DR
  5. Proliferative DR
- Easy-to-use **web interface** using Streamlit
- Pretrained **EfficientNet model** for high accuracy
- Single-image upload and real-time prediction
- Automatic dataset extraction using `dataset.py`
